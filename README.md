# Next Gen QA
- Repository for the thesis project "Next-Gen Website QA: Automated Functional Test Case Creation Using Large Language Models, Prompt Engineering, and Scraping Technologies"

# Setup Commit Notes (01-09-2025)
- created folders
- TODO : 
  - [x] fill up components with prototype code
    - start development procedure
  - [x] fill up fine-tuning with prototype code
    - start information processing procedure
  - [x] start django folder setup: django-admin startproject nextgen next-gen-qa (the names felt a bit ambiguous so it is changed to ngq_project from the folder name of django_ngq)

# Next TODOS (01-13-2025) (backend)
- development of scraper, prompt generator, and table generator (python) using prototype
- development of dataset generator (fine-tuning) using prototype
- finishing setups of ngq_project, ngq_app, for easy component integration (django)
